			<h2>Essay One</h2>
			<p>
				Gregory Bateson’s theory of natural systems as abstracting systems, with
				conscious purpose as a kind of extreme and potentially dangerous
				extension of the abstracting process.
			</p>
			<h3>General Theory</h3>
			<p transition:name=`essay-first-para-${slug}`>
				Gregory Bateson believed that ecosystems and human biology don’t exist
				on the event level, it’s only through viewing on a more abstract level
				do we see the circuits that keep it balanced and functioning. He
				observed that “creatures and plants live together in a combination of
				competition and mutual dependency”<label
					for="sn-438"
					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
					type="checkbox"
					id="sn-438"
					class="margin-toggle"
				/><span class="sidenote">Gregory Bateson, Mind and Nature: A Necessary Unity (New York: Dutton, 1979), 438.</span>. Each component of this biological
				machinery functions as gauges and fail-safes. These elements remain
				invisible when viewed at the physical/sensorial level.
			</p>
			<p>
				This system functions primarily on both levels two and four of
				Korzybski’s abstraction model<label

					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input

				>
				It lives within level two as an autonomous process similar to digestion or
				blood pumping through a living creature. Each part of this system is oblivious
				of the role it plays within the larger whole. Without the existence of every
				component, it begins to falter. Only through bringing this system into the
				verbal fourth level are we able to perceive and put into actual terms the
				full processes happening directly in front of us. Having pulled this ecosystem
				into a fourth-level framework we are able to see what Bateson is trying to
				show us in this paper. He wants the reader to realize that “in a balanced
				ecological system whose underpinnings are of this nature, it is very clear
				that any monkeying with the system is likely to disrupt the equilibrium”<label
					for="sn-438-2"
					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
					type="checkbox"
					id="sn-438-2"
					class="margin-toggle"
				/><span class="sidenote">Bateson, Mind and Nature, 438.</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				He uses the example of the “balance of nature” to illustrate this point.
				The balance of nature is a term used to describe the interconnectedness
				of all living things. Bateson argues that this balance is not a
				conscious act but a natural one. It is only through abstracting the
				system that we are able to see the balance of nature in action.
			</p>

			<h3>The Flaws</h3>
			<p>
				The ability to abstract acts as a double-edged blade, with both the
				success and downfall of humans living in said ecosystems hinged on how
				humanity applies it. His largest concern was that humanity through its
				hubris would latch onto conscious purpose and not realize the harms of
				it. Bateson draws attention to the fact that “conscious purpose is now
				empowered to upset the balance of the body”<label
					for="sn-441"
					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input

				The body in this instance refers to the ecological system we live in.
				“common-sense” of consciousness, which leads to greed and irrational
				decisions<label for="sn-442" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"

					id="sn-442-2"
					class="margin-toggle"
				/><span class="sidenote">Bateson, Mind and Nature, 442.</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is so dangerous as conscious purpose allows humans to sever their
				connection to the ecosystems they inhabit. Bateson uses an
				interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve to exhibit this. He states
				“[Adam] still does not see himself as part of the system in which the
				mess exists, and he either blames the rest of the system or he blames
				himself”<label for="sn-443" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"
				></label><input
					type="checkbox"
					id="sn-443"
					class="margin-toggle"
				/><span class="sidenote">Bateson, Mind and Nature, 443.</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Conscious purpose acts as a pane of frosted glass through which humans
				are unable to see the unintended results of their actions. Humans end up
				viewing themselves in a distorted manner and act as if they exist above
				and are removed from the systems they inhabit. This methodology of
				thinking is dangerous and the cause of these systems’ downfall. This
				will lead to a deterioration as Bateson puts it “Some plants will become
				a weed, some creatures will be exterminated, and the system [...] is
				likely to fall to pieces”<label
					for="sn-438-3"
					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
					type="checkbox"
					id="sn-438-3"
					class="margin-toggle"
				/><span class="sidenote">Bateson, Mind and Nature, 438.</span>. As plants move towards weed and
				animals become either extinct or pests it creates a less hospitable
				environment for the elements that remain. The solution is complex and
				simple, but it begins with humanity realizing the problem is systemic in
				nature<label for="sn-444" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"
				></label><input
					type="checkbox"
					id="sn-444"
					class="margin-toggle"
				/><span class="sidenote">Bateson, Mind and Nature, 444.</span>. Next, Bateson says that the problem
				must then be tackled on an individual scale through humility. It is once
				we combat the arrogance of conscious purpose that humans will be able to
				tackle the damage we have already done<label

			<h2>Essay 2</h2>
			<p>
				How is six-week-old Joey’s experience is different from ours, and where
				do we find the roots of the ability to sense Structure and to
				Differentiate in the midst of the Weatherscape<label
					for="sn-weather"
					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"
				>
				</label>
				<input type="checkbox" id="sn-weather" class="margin-toggle" /><span
					class="sidenote"
					>The Weatherscape is Daniel Stern’s concept describing an infant’s
					early experience where they are fully immersed in sensory and
					emotional input, without a sense of separation between themselves and
					the world around them.</span
				>
			</p>
			<h3>The Difference</h3>
			<p>
				The Weatherscape can best be related to adults as experiencing a flow
				state while doing something they enjoy. It is a state where the person
				within it has full involvement and feels a direct connectedness to the
				outside world. When a baby first comes into the world there is no
				distinct separation between where they end and the world begins. Stern
				phrases this lack of separation as “there is no you to stand outside the
				weather and watch it happen”<label
					for="sn-14"
					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
				<input type="checkbox" id="sn-14" class="margin-toggle" /><span
					class="sidenote">Daniel Stern, "The World of Feelings: Baby Joey at Six Weeks," in The Interpersonal World of the Infant (New York: Basic Books, 1985), 14.</span
				>. As a baby, Joey is forced to exist within all the storms and calms of
				the world around him. Elaborating on this further, “Joey experiences
				objects and events mainly in terms of feelings they evoke in him”<label
					for="sn-13"
					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
				<input type="checkbox" id="sn-13" class="margin-toggle" /><span
					class="sidenote">Stern, "The World of Feelings: Baby Joey at Six Weeks," 13.</span
				>. Joey lives within the Weatherscape which is a continuous existence at
				the lowest level of abstraction. Joey does not care or understand at
				this point anything further than the physical and sensory level. All of
				his brain is grappling with the large influx of new information as “all
				his senses are focused on each one, and he lives each intensely”<label
					for="sn-15"
					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
				<input type="checkbox" id="sn-15" class="margin-toggle" /><span
					class="sidenote">Stern, "The World of Feelings: Baby Joey at Six Weeks," 15.</span
				>. For adults a flow state would function as a temporary pseudo
				Weatherscape.
			</p>
			<h3>Exiting the Weatherscape</h3>
			<p>
				Exiting of the Weatherscape happens as babies start to grasp the concept
				of object permanence. Before this gradual exit, a game of peekaboo
				captivates as new stimuli appear out of supposed thin air before
				disappearing again. As this game loses interest the outside world starts
				to bleed less into the inside world of baby Joey’s mind. This clear
				division is a product of lived experience and recall of past memories.
				Stern points this out when talking about Joey's experience regarding the
				bars on Joey's crib. Joey begins to notice the first bar primes him to
				notice the second”<label
					for="sn-26"
					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
				<input type="checkbox" id="sn-26" class="margin-toggle" /><span
					class="sidenote">Stern, "The World of Feelings: Baby Joey at Six Weeks," 26.</span
				>. Without this the afterglow begins to strengthen Joey will start his
				exit of the Weatherscape.
				<input type="checkbox" id="sn-27" class="margin-toggle" /><span
					class="sidenote">Stern, "The World of Feelings: Baby Joey at Six Weeks," 27.</span
				>, rather than the memories we as adults experience. Once the afterglow
				begins to strengthen Joey will start his exit of the Weatherscape.
			</p>
			<p>
				Stern earlier provides an expansion and progression of this skill by
				bringing up the game Botticelli<label
					for="sn-24"
					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
				<input type="checkbox" id="sn-24" class="margin-toggle" /><span
					class="sidenote">Stern, "The World of Feelings: Baby Joey at Six Weeks," 24.</span
				>. This game requires adults to translate the qualities of an experience
				and attribute it to a specific person<label
					for="sn-25"
					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
				<input type="checkbox" id="sn-25" class="margin-toggle" /><span
					class="sidenote">Stern, "The World of Feelings: Baby Joey at Six Weeks," 25.</span
				>. Babies are born already able to play as their nervous systems are
				wired to work this way although prior experience definitely helps<label
					for="sn-25-2"
					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
				<input type="checkbox" id="sn-25-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span
					class="sidenote">Stern, "The World of Feelings: Baby Joey at Six Weeks," 25.</span
				>. A blindfolded baby after being breastfed will exhibit favouritism
				towards the nipple they had fed upon when later being presented two to
				choose between by merely on sight<label
					for="sn-25-3"
					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
				<input type="checkbox" id="sn-25-3" class="margin-toggle" /><span
					class="sidenote">Stern, "The World of Feelings: Baby Joey at Six Weeks," 25.</span
				>. This decision-making clearly shows the translational skills mentioned
				above.
